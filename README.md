My deprecated cheat module (DLL) for the game called “Prime World”, what was written in 2015 for one person. All the functionality, obviously, has ceased to function for a long time, however, this base can be useful to someone… at least I hope so.

Module was able to block a game protection that was stored in the sakijapi.dll module, turn off the fog of war and display invisible objects on the minimap, like mobs and other player.

I left the code as it was in the original, only changed a couple of places in strings and comments for not to look stupid.

I’m ashamed of this code. It’s actually terrible. :\
